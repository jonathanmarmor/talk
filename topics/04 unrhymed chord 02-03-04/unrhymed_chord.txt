For any number of performers

Sixty-five minutes long - two periods of thirty minutes each, with a five minute silence between them

Each performer finds one sound, preferably with pitch

This sound is played for one duration, between one and fifteen minutes, in each thirty minutes periods, - making sure, in the first period, not to cross over into the silence

The duration of the sound may change from one period to the next

One of the durations may be zero seconds (i.e., a player might decide not to play in one of the sections)

The sound may be sustained for the whole length of the duration chosen - or if it is impossible to sustain the sound for the duration, long sounds may be repeated at regular intervals

The loudness of the sound is in inverse proportion to its duration - i.e., the longer the duration, the softer the sound - the one-minute duration should be a comfortable mp; a fifteen-minute duration will be nearly inaudible.
